    I have never considered myself overly talented at anything. So when asked the question "What do you want to do with your life?" I didn't have a real answer. Of course I always made up an answer when asked this question by my family or friends because you don't want to be the guy without a plan. But thats what I was the guy without a plan. After highschool I was kind of lost. There was always one thing that I kept going back to in my mind I knew I was interested in technology.
		 
		 At the time I felt fairly comfortable with computers and had a basic understanding of how they worked from a hardware aspect. I was too intimidated by software and programming to even consider that career path. So I decided to go for it and find a job in IT, that was the answer to all my problems, that was going to be my place in the world. So I landed my first IT job and made my debut into the technology world. It was not as glorious as I pictured it to be. After a few months I was right back into the same old rut I had been in for the past few years. I didn't have that sense of fullfilment I was looking for. So I went back to the drawing board.
		 
		 I stumbled accross a few videos that caught my eye explaining some basic HTML and CSS concepts. This peeked my interest. I decided to dive a little further into the world of programing. As I continued to dig through YouTubes archives my interest grew and developed into an obsession. I was buying courses online for development and programming. I was constantly wanting to learn about code. Programming was so much more than what I thought it was. I alwasy had this idea of what programming would be like that it was a monotonous career. But its not, it is a world that encourages creativity and thinking outside of the box. A world that allows you to take control of your future with endless possibilities. You dont have to be tied down to one thing you can learn anything you want. That is what I have been searching for in life the freedom to be anything. 
		 
		 Now I am a student at Flatiron School in their Software Engineering program. I am chasing my dreams. I know it won't be easy but in the words of the great Theodore Roosevelt - “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.”
