The rails project has been an absolute pleasure, I have learned a lot about this powerful framework. Several aspects of this project were very challenging. Thankfully there is a ton of documentation to refer to and google is always willing to help you find answers. Once I was finished with most of the backend of this project I decided to challenge myself with some front end styling. I decided to go with a popular tool refered to as bootstrap. Bootstrap made styling possible for me and rewarding. I do not have an eye for style so I used a preconstructed layout and refered to documentation or youtube videos to make everything work. Bootstrap had a steep learning curve for me because most of the documentation is conflicting do to different versions of rails and bootstrap being released over the years. I chose to go with the newest versions of each. After playing around with the formatting of the html and my different views I had an end product that worked well enough for my satisfaction. This project was very rewarding because I feel what I have learned will be applicable to a possible future job and the end product of my project is functional and has some nice styling.
