The sinatra project was tough but very rewarding. This feels like the closest we have come as a cohort to producing something that is comparable to a real world product might look like. To pull together everything I have learned so far in this project was an incredible feeling. Knowing that I am one step closer to my goal fuels my passion to continue learning and developing my skills. This project was a learning experience and really solidified the techniques I have worked so hard to comprehend. Learning how to take what we have been taught and form it into something that actually works and has functionality is amazing, I never thought I would be at the point I am now and knowing that we are not even half way through is terrifying and thrilling
